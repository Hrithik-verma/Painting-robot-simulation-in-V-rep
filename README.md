Painting robot simulation in vrep/coppeliasim

![](picture/painting%20robot.PNG)

This simulation id done in v-rep.In this simulation basic concept of inverse kinematics is used to give points and end effector move to that point.
Please download the scene and run simultion. Than unhide all 6 points and prismatic joint.If you can clearly see than there is 6 point which robot end effector is following using inverse kinematics concept. All 6 point are in a line hence indirectly end effector is following a line. Than all points are connect to prismatic joint which help to change the point location from right to left slowely.Hence such way robot is able to paint entire wall. 
Please see code of robot in the scene to understand more.
